Do you have looked for Open Hardware techonology and found any of your taste? This could be the place
  for you: here are collected devices with well-defined and usable schematics and layouts
  to rebuild/modify and clear license indication for each of these.

<p>
  Open-source hardware (OSH) consists of physical artifacts of technology designed and offered by the open design
  movement. Both free and open-source software (FOSS) as well as open-source hardware is created by this open-source
  culture movement and applies a like concept to a variety of components. It is sometimes, thus, referred to as FOSH
  (free and open source hardware). The term usually means that information about the hardware is easily discerned so
  that others can make it - coupling it closely to the maker movement. Hardware design (i.e. mechanical drawings,
  schematics, bills of material, PCB layout data, HDL source code and integrated circuit layout data), in addition
  to the software that drives the hardware, are all released under free/libre terms. The original sharer gains feedback
  and potentially improvements on the design from the FOSH community. There is now significant evidence that such
  sharing creates enormous economic value.
